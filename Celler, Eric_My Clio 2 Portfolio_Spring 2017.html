          <p>
            My first visualization essay explores the data in the New Nation Votes Dataset.
            Within this dataset, we're able to look at early election results in America.
            By subsetting the data to only include the state of Georgia, I was able to analyze election returns
            in the state of Georgia from the period 1789-1824.  The findings within the data indicate that during this period
            the Jeffersonian Party saw a rise in popularity in the state of Georgia.  For more information, please refer
            the link above, which will take you to the complete essay.

          This essay attempts to take a broad view examination of population changes in the state of Georgia before and
          after the Civil War.  Using the tools of mapping in R combined with the history data library, I was able to look
          at the populations of cities for which there was data available.  By looking at these factors, I was able to see
          that, prior to the Civil War, Savannah by far had the highest population.  However, following the Civil War
          and Atlanta saw itself boom in population thanks to the reconstruction efforts and its superior rail network.

        <p>
           By taking a text analysis approach to the WPA Former Slave Narratives dataset, this essay attempts to look at the
           language used in the narratives of former slaves to get a sense of what the lives of former slaves were like.  By looking
           at the language used in the narratives, and, in this essay specifically, narratives of slaves in Georgia,
           one is able to get a sense of the cultural, economic, and social factors impacting slaves' lives.  Ultimately,
           it appears that the text reveals a trend of a concern for family, religion, and freedom; things we would expect
           to see emerge from the lives of any human, and especially humans living under the conditions of slavery.
